# Notify When Agent Receives Gift

![Notify When Agent Receives Gift example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ctristan/lobotomy-corporation-mods/assets/notify-when-agent-receives-gift.png)

## Overview

Whenever an agent receives a gift, a message will display in the log.

## What does this mod do?

- When an agent receives a gift, a message will be shown in the log saying which agent got which gift.

## Why create this mod?

Later on in the game Iâ€™ll get abnormalities with gifts that I want on all of my agents. While I can watch the portrait
to see when they receive it, some gifts are hard to distinguish visually along with the annoyance of having to visually
check the agent after doing something else. Also gifts in general feel special enough to want to know when someone got
one; weapons and armor have to be purchased so you know you have them but gifts are invisible unless you happen to
notice them in the portrait or gift list for an agent.
