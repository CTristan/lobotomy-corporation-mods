### Bad Luck Protection for Gifts
A mod that provides increasing bad luck protection for agents that work on abnormalities to receive a gift from that abnormality. The rationale is that as an agent works with an abnormality they become more familiar with it, which in turn means they should be more likely to receive a gift from it. It tracks the work count for each agent for each gift, so only the work that agent puts towards that gift will count. Work counts are saved across days, but only if the day is completed; if the day is reset then all the work counts incremented during that day will reset as well and will go back to the numbers they were when the day was started. It wouldn't make sense for an agent to remember what happened after the day is reset.
