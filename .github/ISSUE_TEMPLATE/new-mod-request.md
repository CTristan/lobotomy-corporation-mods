**Note: Avoid proposing copies of other mods.**

- If the other mod is incompatible with our mods, please create a bug report for it instead. This allows us to determine
  what's causing the issue and determine the next course of action.
- If you feel an existing mod lacks certain features, please contact the original author(s) first. Suggest it here only
  if they donâ€™t respond or decline to make changes.

* **What sort of mod would you like to see? Please be as specific and detailed as possible.**

* **What inspired this idea?**

* **Are there other mods that you're aware of that provide similar or related functionality?**

* **(optional) Any other information (e.g. screenshots, save games, links to mods that might have related functionality,
  etc)**
