# Unofficial Bug Fixes

A collection of bug fixes to fix various minor issues in the original game code.

Bugs fixed:

- **Wasted stat upgrades** - If a gift provides a large negative stat bonus (
  e.g. Crumbling Armor -20 HP), then when
  upgrading that stat it would incorrectly treat the upgrade as a lower level
  and not actually improve it.
  For example, when an agent had base level 4 Fortitude but had the Crumbling
  Armor gift with -20 HP it would have a
  modified Fortitude of level 3, and the upgrade would use the modified level
  instead of the base level so Fortitude
  would remain level 3 after the upgrade instead of increasing by 1 (base level
  5, modified level 4).
- **Crumbling Armor gift kills agents after being replaced** - When an agent
  that started the day with Crumbling Armorâ€™s
  gift later replaced the gift with another one, they would still die when
  performing an Attachment work.
