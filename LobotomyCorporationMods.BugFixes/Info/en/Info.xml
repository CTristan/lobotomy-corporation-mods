    <descs>
        <desc>Fixes the following bugs:</desc>
        <desc/>
        <desc>* Wasted stat points: If a gift provides a large negative stat bonus (e.g. Crumbling Armor -20 HP), then
            when upgrading that stat it would incorrectly treat the upgrade as a lower level and not actually improve
            it.
        </desc>
        <desc>* Crumbling Armor gift kills agents after being replaced - When an agent that started the day with
            Crumbling Armor’s gift later replaced the gift with another one, they would still die when performing an
            Attachment work.
