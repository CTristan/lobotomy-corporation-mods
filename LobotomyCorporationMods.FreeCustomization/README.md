# Free Customization

![Free Customization example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ctristan/lobotomy-corporation-mods/assets/free-customization.png)

## Overview

Allows customizing (and re-customizing) agents without having to spend additional LOB points.

## Rationale

I do not like when games require a cost for customizing a character in the first place, but in this game customizing requires spending an additional LOB point which you only get a limited number of each day and is also used to hire agents and improve stats.
The fact that customizing an agent directly affects your gameplay bothers me, so this mod will make customizing agents not require any additional points.
