# Warn When Agent Will Die From Working

![Warn When Agent Will Dire From Working example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ctristan/lobotomy-corporation-mods/assets/warn-when-agent-will-die-from-working.png)

## Overview

Provides a visual warning when an agent is guaranteed to die if assigned to work on an abnormality.
The warning only appears when an abnormality has been fully observed to avoid spoiling newly-acquired abnormalities.

## Rationale

Discovering how to deal with abnormalities is a major part of the game, however later on there are so many that have
instant death abilities that are hard to keep track of.
Itâ€™s very annoying being almost done with a day with no deaths but then having an agent die because either I forgot
about an instant death condition, the agent had a temporary condition that I wasn't aware was still affecting them, or
it triggered because of a rare edge case.

Just to be clear, this is only for cases where the agent is guaranteed to die because of an instant-kill mechanic, not
because they would die from low health/sanity or sending a low-chance agent would cause a bad result.

## Abnormality Warnings (Spoilers)

Provides warnings for the following abnormalities and any of their conditions (*spoilers*):

- **Beauty and the Beast**
    - Assigning Repression work to Beauty and the Beast when the last work performed on Beauty and the Beast was
      Repression.
- **Bloodbath**
    - Agent has either Fortitude or Temperance Level 1.
- **Blue Star**
    - Agent has Prudence below Level 5 or Temperance below Level 4 (which would cause the work to take longer than 60
      seconds).
- **Crumbling Armor**
    - Any of the following are true:
        - Agent has Fortitude Level 1
        - Assigning Attachment work (to any abnormality) while agent has the Crumbling Armor gift.
- **Fairy Festival**
    - Assigning work to any other abnormality while agent has the effect.
- **Happy Teddy Bear**
    - Re-assigning the agent that last worked with Happy Teddy Bear.
- **Laetitia**
    - Assigning work to any other abnormality while agent has the effect.
- **Nothing There**
    - Agent has Fortitude below Level 4 while Nothing There is disguised.
- **Parasite Tree**
    - Assigning work when Parasite Tree has four bulbs and the agent doesn't have the effect (which would cause the
      fifth bulb to appear).
- **Red Shoes**
    - Agent has Temperance below Level 3.
- **Singing Machine**
    - Any of the following are true:
        - Qliphoth Counter is 0.
        - Agent has Temperance below Level 3.
        - Agent either has Fortitude above Level 3 or if the agent does not have the gift and receiving the gift would
          increase their Fortitude above Level 3 (causing the agent to die upon receiving the gift).
- **Spider Bud**
    - Any of the following are true:
        - Agent has Prudence Level 1.
        - Assigning Insight work to Spider Bud.
- **Void Dream**
    - Agent has Temperance Level 1.
- **Warm-Hearted Woodsman**
    - Qliphoth Counter is 0.
