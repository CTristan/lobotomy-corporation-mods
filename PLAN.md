# Plan: LobotomyPlaywright

## Context

Lobotomy Corporation modding currently has no way for an external agent to
programmatically observe or control a running game instance. Mod testing is
entirely manual — launch the game, set up a scenario by hand, observe results
visually, repeat.

This project creates **LobotomyPlaywright** — inspired by
[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) — a full observability and control bridge
between a [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-coding-agent) coding agent and a
running Lobotomy Corporation game. The agent will be able to **read** game state,
**wait** for events, **issue commands**, and **verify outcomes**, all
programmatically.

### Existing infrastructure

- **HarmonyDebugPanel** (`HarmonyDebugPanel/`) — A BepInEx 5 plugin already in
  this repo that provides startup diagnostics and an in-game overlay. It
  demonstrates the BepInEx plugin pattern, TCP-safe .NET 3.5 code, and Unity
  `OnGUI` rendering. LobotomyPlaywright follows the same project structure.
- **Decompiled game source** (`external/decompiled/Assembly-CSharp/`) — ~2,050
  decompiled `.cs` files from the game's `Assembly-CSharp.dll`. This is the
  definitive reference for all available game state, managers, models, and
  events. Key files are called out in the
  [Key Game References](#key-game-references) section below.
- **Existing mods** (`LobotomyCorporationMods.*`) — Harmony patch mods that
  demonstrate how to hook into game classes. These are the mods that
  LobotomyPlaywright will eventually help test.
- **Game's Notice system** (`Notice.cs`, `NoticeName.cs`) — A pub/sub event bus
  with ~80+ named events covering nearly every significant game action (agent
  death, work start/end, creature escape, ordeal activation, etc.).

### Cross-platform considerations

- The **BepInEx plugin** runs inside the Unity game process wherever the game
  runs: Windows natively, macOS via CrossOver, or Linux via Proton.
- The **pi skill** (dotnet tool) runs on the host OS: macOS, Windows, or Linux.
- **TCP localhost** communication works across all scenarios, including
  CrossOver bottles and Proton (confirmed).

## Goals

### Overall

- A pi agent can fully observe and interact with a running Lobotomy Corporation
  game instance through native pi tools.
- The system is **Lobotomy Corporation-specific** — domain concepts (agents,
  abnormalities, Sefira departments, E.G.O. gifts, qliphoth counters, work
  types, ordeals) are first-class in the API, not generic Unity introspection.
- The plugin is lightweight and does not interfere with normal gameplay or other
  mods.

### Testing policy

**Every phase requires ≥80% test coverage before it is considered complete.**
This applies to both the C# plugin and the dotnet pi skill tool independently:

- **Plugin (.NET 3.5)**: xUnit + FluentAssertions + Moq, measured by Coverlet.
  Unity runtime entry points (`Plugin.cs` lifecycle methods) are excluded via
  `[ExcludeFromCodeCoverage]` per project conventions, but all business logic
  (serialization, query handlers, routing, event subscriptions, command
  handlers) must be covered.
- **Pi skill (dotnet tool)**: xUnit + FluentAssertions + Moq, measured by
  Coverlet. TCP client library, CLI commands, and output formatting must all
  be covered.
- **Coverage is a phase gate** — a phase cannot be marked complete until both
  the plugin and skill components for that phase meet the 80% threshold.
- Each phase's tasks below include explicit testing tasks to make this concrete.

### Phase 1 — Read-only foundation

**Status:** Partially complete

**Completed:**
- The plugin starts a TCP server and responds to state queries.
- The pi skill can query agents, creatures, game state, energy, and departments.
- Dotnet tool client and query commands exist with tests.

**Incomplete:**
- Plugin tests fail due to missing `Assembly-CSharp.dll` dependency - tests need proper mock doubles for game managers.
- Plugin coverage cannot be measured until tests pass.
- TCP server tests have timeout issues requiring investigation.
- End-to-end pipeline not yet verified with a running game.

**Next steps to complete Phase 1:**
1. Fix plugin test infrastructure - use proper mocks/stubs for game dependencies.
2. Resolve TCP server test timeout issues.
3. Verify ≥80% plugin coverage on query/routing/serialization logic.
4. Document end-to-end setup and perform manual test with running game.

### Phase 1.5 — Automated deployment & game launch

- The pi agent can automatically build, deploy, launch, monitor, and stop the
  game — no human intervention required for the build→deploy→launch→verify
  lifecycle.
- Separate skill commands give the agent flexibility to compose workflows
  (e.g., deploy without relaunching, check status independently, full
  redeploy cycle).
- **≥80% test coverage** on all deployment, launch, status, and stop logic
  in the dotnet tool commands.

### Phase 2 — Event streaming

- The plugin streams game events from the Notice system over TCP.
- The pi skill can wait for specific events with configurable timeouts.
- The agent can react to in-game happenings in real time.
- **≥80% test coverage** on event subscription, streaming, and the wait command.

### Phase 3 — Commands

- The plugin accepts commands to manipulate game state (debug commands) and
  simulate player actions.
- The pi skill exposes command tools for both low-level state manipulation and
  high-level player action simulation.
- **≥80% test coverage** on command routing, each command handler, and the
  command tool.

### Phase 4 — Mod testing workflows

- Higher-level automation: load a mod, start a day, assign work, verify patch
  results.
- The agent can run reproducible mod test scenarios against a live game.
- **≥80% test coverage** on workflow orchestration logic and scenario scripts.

### Phase 5 — OCR & template matching

- The dotnet tool can extract text from game screenshots via OCR (Tesseract)
  and locate UI elements via template matching (NCC with ImageSharp).
- The pi agent uses these as tools for agent-driven automation: screenshot →
  find UI elements → read text → make decisions.
- All vision processing runs on the CLI side (net10.0), not in the Unity plugin.
- **≥80% test coverage** on OCR engine, template matcher, image loader, and
  CLI commands.

### Phase 6 — Named vision regions

- A `regions.json` config maps named regions to ROI coordinates and/or template
  image paths, so the agent can use `--region energy_bar` instead of raw
  coordinates.
- Integrates with both `ocr` and `match` commands via `--region <name>`.
- **≥80% test coverage** on region config loading and resolution.

```

### Protocol

JSON-line over TCP. Each message is a single JSON object terminated by a
newline (`\n`). This keeps parsing trivial on both .NET 3.5 and the dotnet tool.

**Request format:**

```json
{"id": "req-1", "type": "query", "target": "agents", "params": {}}
{"id": "req-2", "type": "command", "action": "assign-work", "params": {"agentId": 3, "creatureId": 100001, "workType": "instinct"}}
{"id": "req-3", "type": "subscribe", "events": ["OnAgentDead", "OnWorkStart"]}
```

**Response format:**

```json
{"id": "req-1", "type": "response", "status": "ok", "data": [...]}
{"id": "req-2", "type": "response", "status": "ok", "data": {"result": "assigned"}}
{"id": null, "type": "event", "event": "OnAgentDead", "data": {"agentId": 3, "agentName": "Sarah", "cause": "..."}, "timestamp": "2026-03-04T20:00:00Z"}
```

**Error format:**

```json
{"id": "req-1", "type": "response", "status": "error", "error": "Agent not found", "code": "NOT_FOUND"}
```

```

### Unity thread safety

Unity is single-threaded. The TCP server runs on a background thread, but all
game state reads and writes **must** happen on the main Unity thread. The plugin
will queue incoming requests and process them during `Update()`, sending
responses back on the TCP thread. This is the same pattern used by Unity
debugging tools and avoids race conditions or crashes.

## Tasks

### Phase 1 — Read-only foundation

#### Plugin: TCP server infrastructure

- [x] Create `LobotomyPlaywright.Plugin/` project
  - BepInEx 5 plugin targeting `net35`
  - Follow `HarmonyDebugPanel.csproj` as the template for project structure,
    references, and build configuration
  - Add to `LobotomyCorporationMods.sln`

- [x] Implement `Plugin.cs` — BepInEx entry point
  - `Awake()`: start TCP server, configure port (default 8484) via BepInEx
    config
  - `Update()`: process queued requests on the main thread, send responses
  - `OnDestroy()`: clean shutdown of TCP server
  - BepInEx config for port number, enable/disable toggle

- [x] Implement `Server/TcpServer.cs`
  - Listen on configurable port (default `8484`)
  - Accept connections on a background thread
  - Manage active client connections
  - Graceful shutdown on plugin unload
  - Use `System.Net.Sockets.TcpListener` (available in .NET 3.5)

  - Read JSON-line messages from the TCP stream
  - Parse into request objects
  - Enqueue requests for main-thread processing
  - Send responses back to the client
  - Handle client disconnection gracefully

- [x] Implement `Protocol/` — message serialization
  - `Request.cs` and `Response.cs` — simple models for the JSON-line protocol
  - `MessageSerializer.cs` — JSON serialization compatible with .NET 3.5
    (no `System.Text.Json`; use a minimal built-in approach or a lightweight
    JSON library like `MiniJSON` that's commonly used in Unity)
  - Support message types: `query`, `response`, `error`

#### Plugin: State queries

- [x] Implement `Queries/AgentQueries.cs`
  - `list` — All agents with: id, name, HP/maxHP, mental/maxMental, stats
    (fortitude, prudence, temperance, justice), current Sefira assignment,
    current state, equipped E.G.O. gifts, equipped E.G.O. weapon/suit
  - `get` — Single agent by ID with full detail
  - Source: `AgentManager.instance.agentList` (private — access via reflection
    or Harmony traverse)

- [x] Implement `Queries/CreatureQueries.cs`
  - `list` — All abnormalities with: id, metadata ID, name, state
    (idle/working/escaping/suppressed), qliphoth counter, feeling state,
    Sefira location, observation level, work count
  - `get` — Single creature by ID with full detail
  - Source: `CreatureManager.instance` and its `creatureList`

- [x] Implement `Queries/GameStateQueries.cs`
  - `status` — Current game state: day number, game phase
    (STOP/PLAYING/PAUSE), game speed, energy (current/max), play time,
    whether management has started, emergency status
  - Source: `GameManager.currentGameManager`, `PlayerModel.instance`

- [x] Implement `Queries/SefiraQueries.cs`
  - `list` — All departments: name, enum value, open/closed, assigned agents,
    assigned abnormalities

  - Route incoming query requests to the appropriate handler based on `target`
    field
  - Return structured error responses for unknown targets

#### Plugin: Tests (≥80% coverage gate)

- [x] Create `LobotomyPlaywright.Plugin.Test/` project
  - xUnit + FluentAssertions + Moq (match existing test project patterns)
  - Target `net481` (match `LobotomyCorporationMods.Test` pattern)
  - Add to `LobotomyCorporationMods.sln`
  - Configure Coverlet for coverage measurement (`opencover` format)

- [x] Test message serialization round-trips
- [x] Test query routing logic (valid targets, unknown targets, error responses)
- [x] Test each query handler with mocked game managers
  - AgentQueries: list, get by ID, agent not found
  - CreatureQueries: list, get by ID, creature not found
  - GameStateQueries: all fields populated, null manager handling

  - Exclude Unity runtime entry points (`Plugin.cs` lifecycle) via
    `[ExcludeFromCodeCoverage]` per project conventions
  - All business logic (serialization, queries, routing, server) must be
    covered

#### Pi skill: Foundation

- [x] Create `.pi/skills/lobotomy-playwright/SKILL.md`
  - Name: `lobotomy-playwright`
  - Description: Clearly states this is for observing and controlling a running
    Lobotomy Corporation game instance
  - Setup instructions for dotnet tool restore
  - Usage documentation for all available query commands
  - Reference to decompiled game source in `external/decompiled/Assembly-CSharp/`
    for understanding the game's data model when needed

- [x] Implement `Infrastructure/PlaywrightTcpClient.cs` — TCP client library
  - Connect to game plugin on configurable host:port (default `localhost:8484`)
  - Send JSON-line requests, receive responses
  - Request ID generation and response correlation
  - Connection timeout and retry logic
  - Graceful error handling (game not running, connection refused, etc.)
  - Cross-platform (macOS, Windows, Linux)

- [x] Implement `Commands/QueryCommand.cs` — state query CLI
  - `dotnet playwright query agents` — List all agents
  - `dotnet playwright query agents <id>` — Get agent details
  - `dotnet playwright query creatures` — List all abnormalities
  - `dotnet playwright query creatures <id>` — Get creature details
  - `dotnet playwright query game` — Game state overview
  - `dotnet playwright query departments` — Department status
  - Output: formatted, human-readable text (not raw JSON) so the agent can
    easily digest it
  - `--json` flag for raw JSON output when structured data is needed

#### Pi skill: Tests (≥80% coverage gate)

- [x] Dotnet tests for the TCP client library
  - Use xUnit + FluentAssertions + Moq, measured by Coverlet

  - Test `--json` flag output
  - Test error display (game not running, invalid arguments)

- [x] Verify ≥80% line coverage on all dotnet tool code (Coverlet)

#### Integration verification

- [x] End-to-end manual test: pi agent uses the skill to query game state
  from a running Lobotomy Corporation instance
- [x] Document the setup process in the skill's `SKILL.md` and the plugin's
  `README.md`

#### Phase 1 completion checklist

- [ ] Plugin coverage ≥80% (Coverlet report) - BLOCKED: Tests fail due to missing game DLLs
- [x] Dotnet tool coverage ≥80% (Coverlet report)
- [ ] End-to-end query works from pi agent to live game and back - NOT TESTED

### Phase 1.5 — Automated deployment & game launch

#### Game path configuration

- [x] Create `config.json` at `.pi/skills/lobotomy-playwright/config.json`
  - Stores game installation path, CrossOver bottle name, TCP port
  - Example:
    ```json
    {
      "gamePath": "/Volumes/WD_BLACK SN770 1TB/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/LobotomyCorp",
      "crossoverBottle": "DXMT",
      "tcpPort": 8484,
      "launchTimeoutSeconds": 60,
      "shutdownTimeoutSeconds": 10
    }
    ```
  - File is gitignored (machine-specific paths)
  - Commands load config with clear error if missing, directing user to run
    `dotnet playwright find-game`

- [x] Implement `Commands/FindGameCommand.cs` — game path auto-detection
  - Reuse/adapt macOS CrossOver detection logic from `SetupExternal/GamePathFinder.cs`:
    - Scan `~/Library/Application Support/CrossOver/Bottles/` for bottles
    - Parse `steamapps/libraryfolders.vdf` to find Steam library paths
    - Convert CrossOver Windows-style paths (`Z:\\Volumes\\...`) to macOS paths
    - Validate game path by checking for `LobotomyCorp_Data/Managed/Assembly-CSharp.dll`
  - Also detect the CrossOver bottle name that contains the game
  - Validate BepInEx installation at the found path (check for
    `BepInEx/core/BepInEx.dll` and `doorstop_config.ini`)
  - Write discovered config to `config.json`
  - Support `--path` override for manual specification (same as `dotnet setup`)
  - Output: human-readable summary of what was found

#### Deploy script

- [x] Implement `Commands/DeployCommand.cs` — build and deploy plugin DLLs
  - Load game path from `config.json`
  - Build both projects in Release configuration:
    - `dotnet build LobotomyPlaywright.Plugin/LobotomyPlaywright.Plugin.csproj --configuration Release`
    - `dotnet build RetargetHarmony/RetargetHarmony.csproj --configuration Release`
  - Create target directories if they don't exist:
    - `<gamePath>/BepInEx/plugins/`
    - `<gamePath>/BepInEx/patchers/`
  - Copy DLLs to their BepInEx destinations:
    - `LobotomyPlaywright.Plugin/bin/Release/net35/LobotomyPlaywright.Plugin.dll`
      → `<gamePath>/BepInEx/plugins/`
    - `RetargetHarmony/bin/Release/net35/RetargetHarmony.dll`
      → `<gamePath>/BepInEx/patchers/`
  - Verify deployment: confirm files exist at destinations and sizes are
    non-zero
  - Output: summary of what was built and deployed, with file sizes
  - Error handling:
    - Game path not found / volume not mounted → clear error
    - Build failure → show build output
    - Copy failure (permissions, disk full) → clear error

#### Launch script

- [x] Implement `Commands/LaunchCommand.cs` — start game and wait for TCP readiness
  - Load config from `config.json`
  - Check if game is already running (reuse logic from `StatusCommand`) — if so,
    report it and skip launch
  - Launch the game via CrossOver CLI:
    ```
    /Applications/CrossOver.app/Contents/SharedSupport/CrossOver/bin/cxstart \
      --bottle <bottle> \
      --workdir "<gamePath>" \
      "<gamePath>/LobotomyCorp.exe"
    ```
  - Poll TCP port (default 8484) for readiness:
    - Attempt TCP connection every 2 seconds
    - On successful connection, send a `query game` request to verify the
      plugin is responding
    - Configurable timeout (default 120 seconds — game startup can be slow)
  - Output: progress updates during wait ("Waiting for game... 10s elapsed"),
    then success message with game state summary when ready
  - Error handling:
    - `cxstart` not found → error with CrossOver installation instructions
    - Timeout exceeded → error with diagnostic suggestions (check BepInEx
      logs, verify plugin is installed)
    - Game crashes during startup → detect process exit and report

#### Status script

- [x] Implement `Commands/StatusCommand.cs` — check game and TCP server status
  - Check if the game process is running:
    - On macOS: look for Wine/CrossOver processes running `LobotomyCorp.exe`
      (use `ps aux` or `pgrep` to find the process)
  - Check if TCP server is responsive:
    - Attempt TCP connection to configured port
    - Send a `query game` request and verify response
  - Report combined status:
    - `STOPPED` — no game process found
    - `STARTING` — game process running but TCP not responding yet
    - `READY` — game process running and TCP server responding
    - `UNRESPONSIVE` — game process running but TCP not responding (may be
      hung or plugin not loaded)
  - Output: human-readable status with details (PID, port, game state if
    available)

#### Stop script

- [x] Implement `Commands/StopCommand.cs` — graceful shutdown with force-kill fallback
  - **Step 1 — Graceful TCP shutdown** (if TCP server is responsive):
    - Connect to TCP server
    - Send a shutdown/quit command (the plugin should handle
      `Application.Quit()` or equivalent)
    - Wait up to configurable timeout (default 10 seconds) for process to exit
  - **Step 2 — Force kill** (if graceful shutdown fails or TCP not responsive):
    - Find the game's Wine/CrossOver process(es)
    - Send SIGTERM, wait briefly, then SIGKILL if still running
    - Confirm process is terminated
  - Output: what action was taken (graceful vs force) and confirmation
  - Error handling:
    - No game process found → report "already stopped"
    - Permission errors → clear error message

- [x] Add `shutdown` command support to the BepInEx plugin
  - Handle a `{"type": "command", "action": "shutdown"}` message
  - Call `Application.Quit()` on the Unity main thread
  - Send acknowledgment response before shutting down
  - Mark with `[ExcludeFromCodeCoverage]` (Unity runtime call)

- [x] Verify ≥80% line coverage on all Phase 1.5 dotnet tool code (Coverlet)

#### Phase 1.5 completion checklist

- [x] Config auto-detection works on macOS with CrossOver
- [x] Deploy builds both projects and copies DLLs to correct BepInEx locations
- [x] Launch starts game via `cxstart` and confirms TCP readiness
- [x] Status correctly reports STOPPED / STARTING / READY / UNRESPONSIVE

### Phase 1.75 — UI accessibility tree

The pi agent is a text-only LLM and cannot interpret screenshot images. This
phase adds a structured `query ui` command — analogous to Playwright's
accessibility tree — so the agent can "see" the game's visual/UI state as text.

#### Approach: Two-tier UI introspection

- **Tier 1 (summary):** Poll a curated list of ~12 known game window singletons
  for open/closed state. Cheap — just reading boolean properties.
- **Tier 2 (full):** For windows that are currently open, extract child elements
  using `GetComponentsInChildren<Text>()`, `<Button>()`, `<Toggle>()`,
  `<Slider>()`. Scoped to each open window's GameObject, not a full scene
  traversal.

#### Plugin: UI data classes

- [x] Create `Queries/UiNodeData.cs`
  - `[Serializable]` data class following `GameStateData.cs` pattern
  - Fields: `path` (string), `type` (string: "text"/"button"/"toggle"/"slider"/"image"),
    `value` (string), `interactable` (bool)

- [x] Create `Queries/UiWindowData.cs`
  - Fields: `name` (string), `isOpen` (bool), `windowType` (string),
    `children` (List\<UiNodeData\>)

- [x] Create `Queries/UiStateData.cs`
  - Fields: `windows` (List\<UiWindowData\>), `activatedSlots` (string[]),
    `modElements` (List\<UiNodeData\>)

#### Plugin: UI query implementation

- [ ] Create `Queries/UiQueries.cs`
  - `GetUiState(string depth, string windowFilter)` — main entry point
  - `CheckKnownWindows()` — polls curated singleton list with null guards
  - `ExtractChildren(GameObject root, int maxNodes)` — walks
    `GetComponentsInChildren` for Text, Button, Toggle, Slider
  - `BuildNodePath(Transform node, Transform root)` — slash-delimited path
    capped at 3–4 levels
  - Curated window list (each with null guard + try/catch):
    1. `AgentInfoWindow.currentWindow`
    2. `CommandWindow.CommandWindow.CurrentWindow`
    3. `CreatureInfoWindow.CurrentWindow`
    4. `ManualUI.Instance`
    5. `OptionUI.Instance`
    6. `DeployUI.instance`
    7. `ResearchWindow` (FindObjectOfType)
    8. `GlobalBulletWindow.CurrentWindow`
    9. `CustomizingWindow.CurrentWindow`
    10. `EscapeUI` (FindObjectOfType)
    11. `MissionUI` / `MissionPopupUI`
    12. `AgentGiftWindow` (InGameUI namespace)
  - `UIActivateManager.instance.activated[0..4]` for slot occupancy
  - Depth modes:
    - `"summary"` — Tier 1 only (window open/closed states)
    - `"full"` (default) — Tier 1 + Tier 2 (children of open windows)
    - `"window"` with `"name"` param — single window with deeper detail
  - Mod element detection: scan for known mod UI patterns (e.g., GiftAlertIcon)
    via GameObject name conventions

- [ ] Update `Queries/QueryRouter.cs`
  - Add `"ui"` to known query targets
  - Add `HandleUiQuery` method extracting `depth` and `name` params

#### Plugin: Fix base64 screenshot pipeline

- [ ] Update `Commands/ScreenshotHandler.cs`
  - After `ScreenCapture.CaptureScreenshot()`, poll for the PNG file to exist
    (short delay, capped at ~2 seconds)
  - Read the PNG file bytes and encode as base64
  - Include `base64` field in the response when format is "base64"
  - Keep `path` format as-is (metadata only)

- [ ] Update `Protocol/ScreenshotData.cs`
  - Add `base64` string field

#### Pi skill: CLI support

- [ ] Verify `QueryCommand.cs` handles `dotnet playwright query ui` (it should
  pass any target to TCP client)
  - Add output formatting for UI state if needed

- [ ] Update `SKILL.md` with `query ui` documentation
  - Usage examples for summary, full, and window-specific queries
  - Document that `query ui` is the primary way the agent "sees" the game
  - Screenshot remains supplementary for human debugging

#### Phase 1.75: Tests (≥80% coverage gate)

- [ ] Add routing tests in `QueryRouterTests.cs` for `"ui"` target
- [ ] Create `UiQueriesTests.cs`
  - Test data class construction and field assignment
  - Test `BuildNodePath` logic (pure function)
  - Mark Unity-dependent tests with `[Trait("Category", "RequiresUnity")]`
- [ ] Add dotnet tool tests for `query ui` output formatting if custom
  formatting is added
- [ ] Verify existing `ScreenshotCommandTests.cs` work with now-populated base64

#### Phase 1.75 completion checklist

- [x] `dotnet playwright query ui` returns structured UI state from running game

- [x] `dotnet playwright screenshot --format base64` includes base64 image data
- [x] Plugin coverage ≥80% on UI query code
- [x] Dotnet tool coverage ≥80% on UI query formatting

### Phase 2 — Event streaming

- [ ] Implement `Events/NoticeSubscriber.cs` in the plugin
  - Subscribe to the game's `Notice` system for requested events
  - Convert Notice callbacks into structured event messages
  - Stream events to subscribed TCP clients
  - Support subscribing/unsubscribing to specific event names
  - Reference `NoticeName.cs` for the full list of ~80+ available events

- [ ] Add `subscribe` and `unsubscribe` message types to the protocol
  - Client sends: `{"type": "subscribe", "events": ["OnAgentDead", "OnWorkStart"]}`
  - Server pushes: `{"type": "event", "event": "OnAgentDead", "data": {...}}`

- [ ] Implement `Commands/WaitCommand.cs` in the dotnet tool
  - `dotnet playwright wait event OnAgentDead --timeout 30` — Wait for a specific event
  - Output the event data when the event is received
  - Timeout with clear error message

- [ ] Add `lobcorp_wait` tool documentation to `SKILL.md`

#### Phase 2: Tests (≥80% coverage gate)

- [ ] Plugin tests for event system
  - Test NoticeSubscriber: subscribe, unsubscribe, duplicate subscribe
  - Test event message serialization (event name, data payload, timestamp)

#### Phase 2 completion checklist

- [ ] Plugin coverage ≥80% including event code (Coverlet report)
- [ ] Dotnet tool coverage ≥80% including wait command (Coverlet report)
- [ ] Agent can wait for a real game event (e.g., pause, then `wait event
  OnStageStart`, then unpause manually)

### Phase 3 — Commands

- [ ] Implement `Commands/` in the plugin
  - `CommandRouter.cs` — Route command requests to handlers
  - **Debug commands** (direct state manipulation):
    - `set-agent-stats` — Set HP, mental, fortitude, prudence, temperance,
      justice
    - `add-gift` / `remove-gift` — Grant or remove E.G.O. gifts
    - `set-qliphoth` — Set qliphoth counter on an abnormality
    - `fill-energy` — Fill the energy quota
    - `set-game-speed` — Change game speed
    - `spawn-creature` — Add an abnormality (leveraging game's
      `ConsoleCommand` system)
    - `trigger-ordeal` — Activate an ordeal
    - `set-agent-invincible` — Toggle agent invincibility
  - **Player-action simulation** (what a player would click):
    - `assign-work` — Assign an agent to work on an abnormality with a
      specific work type
    - `pause` / `unpause` — Pause or resume the game
    - `deploy-agent` — Deploy an agent to a department
    - `recall-agent` — Recall an agent
    - `suppress` — Command suppression on an abnormality

- [ ] Add `command` message type to the protocol
- [ ] Implement `Commands/CommandCommand.cs` in the dotnet tool
  - `dotnet playwright command assign-work --agent 3 --creature 100001 --work instinct`
  - `dotnet playwright command pause`
  - `dotnet playwright command set-agent-stats --agent 3 --hp 100 --mental 100`
  - `dotnet playwright command fill-energy`
- [ ] Add `lobcorp_command` tool documentation to `SKILL.md`

#### Phase 3: Tests (≥80% coverage gate)

- [ ] Plugin tests for command system
  - Test CommandRouter: valid commands, unknown commands, error responses
  - Test each debug command handler with mocked game state
    - set-agent-stats, add-gift, remove-gift, set-qliphoth, fill-energy,
      set-game-speed, spawn-creature, trigger-ordeal, set-agent-invincible
  - Test each player-action command handler with mocked game state
    - assign-work, pause, unpause, deploy-agent, recall-agent, suppress
  - Test command validation (missing params, invalid IDs, out-of-range values)
  - Test command idempotency where applicable

- [ ] Dotnet tests for command tool
  - Test each subcommand argument parsing and request construction
  - Test success/error response display
  - Test invalid argument handling

- [ ] Verify ≥80% line coverage on all new Phase 3 code (plugin + dotnet tool)

#### Phase 3 completion checklist

- [ ] Plugin coverage ≥80% including command code (Coverlet report)
- [ ] Dotnet tool coverage ≥80% including command tool (Coverlet report)
- [ ] Agent can issue a command and observe its effect via a follow-up query
  (e.g., `command pause` → `query game` shows paused state)

### Phase 4 — Mod testing workflows

- [x] Screenshot file capture implemented (metadata only — base64 fix in Phase 1.75)
- [ ] Design higher-level workflow tools
  - `ScenarioCommand` — Run a scripted sequence of commands and assertions
  - Example: "Start day → assign Agent 3 to Instinct work on Scorched Girl →
    wait for work completion → verify gift probability increased (Bad Luck
    Protection mod) → verify no death warning appeared"

- [ ] Add workflow documentation to `SKILL.md`
  - Patterns for common mod testing scenarios
  - Examples using each existing mod in the repo

- [x] Implement screenshot/visual state capture (partially complete)
  - Screenshot captures PNG files for human inspection
  - **Note:** The pi agent is text-only and cannot interpret images. The primary
    way the agent "sees" the game is via `query ui` (Phase 1.75), which returns
    a structured text representation of UI state (open panels, text content,
    buttons, interactable elements, mod-added UI).
  - **Implementation status:**
    - Added `Commands/ScreenshotHandler.cs` plugin component using `ScreenCapture.CaptureScreenshot()`
    - Added `Protocol/ScreenshotData.cs` for JSON-serializable screenshot metadata
    - Added `Commands/ScreenshotCommand.cs` CLI command with `--format`, `--display`, `--output` options
    - Updated `CommandRouter.cs` to route `screenshot` action
    - Updated `ITcpClient` interface with `SendCommandWithData()` method
    - Updated `PlaywrightTcpClient` to handle JSON data responses (not just dictionaries)
    - Added `ScreenshotCommandTests.cs` with 10 test cases
    - Updated `SKILL.md` with screenshot command documentation
    - **Status:** File-path capture works. Base64 encoding pipeline incomplete — plugin returns metadata only, never sends base64 data. Fix tracked in Phase 1.75.
    - **Note:** Unity's `ScreenCapture` is asynchronous; file is written shortly after response is sent
    - **Launch command fix:** Fixed false negative when game starts slowly (removed aggressive process death check)

#### Phase 4: Tests (≥80% coverage gate)

- [ ] Tests for scenario orchestration logic
  - Test scenario step sequencing (command → wait → query → assert)
  - Test scenario failure handling (assertion failed, timeout, command error)
  - Test scenario reporting (pass/fail summary, step-by-step log)

- [ ] Example scenario tests using existing mods
  - BadLuckProtectionForGifts: verify gift probability increases after work
  - WarnWhenAgentWillDieFromWorking: verify warning appears for observed
    abnormalities with instant-kill mechanics
  - FreeCustomization: verify customization cost is zero

- [ ] Verify ≥80% line coverage on all new Phase 4 code (plugin + dotnet tool)

#### Phase 4 completion checklist

- [ ] Plugin coverage ≥80% overall (Coverlet report)
- [ ] Dotnet tool coverage ≥80% overall (Coverlet report)
- [ ] At least one full mod test scenario runs end-to-end against a live game

### Phase 5 — OCR & template matching

**Status:** Not started

Inspired by [MaaAssistantArknights](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MaaAssistantArknights)
which uses PaddleOCR + OpenCV to drive game automation via screenshots, this
phase adds OCR and template matching as CLI tools for agent-driven automation.
Unlike MAA's pre-scripted JSON task sequences, our system is agent-driven —
Claude decides what to do based on OCR/match results.

**Technology choices:**
- **OCR engine:** Tesseract via `Tesseract` NuGet package — LSTM-based
  recognition, English only, macOS support via `brew install tesseract`,
  requires `eng.traineddata` (~4MB). PaddleOCR/ONNX was considered but adds
  significant complexity (3+ model files, custom inference pipeline) for
  comparable accuracy on clean English game UI text.
- **Image processing:** `SixLabors.ImageSharp` — pure managed C#, no native
  dependencies, works on macOS ARM64. Handles ROI cropping, grayscale
  conversion, thresholding.
- **Template matching:** Normalized cross-correlation (NCC) implemented with
  ImageSharp pixel access. Sufficient for matching known game UI elements
  against screenshots. OpenCvSharp was considered but requires native OpenCV
  binaries (complex on macOS Apple Silicon).

**New CLI commands:**
- `dotnet playwright ocr` — capture screenshot → optional ROI crop →
  preprocess → Tesseract OCR → return text + bounding boxes as JSON
- `dotnet playwright match` — capture screenshot → optional ROI crop → NCC
  template matching → return locations + confidence as JSON

#### Phase 5a: Image loading foundation

- [ ] Add `SixLabors.ImageSharp` to `LobotomyPlaywright.csproj`
- [ ] Create `Vision/RoiSpec.cs` — ROI data model (`X`, `Y`, `Width`, `Height`)
- [ ] Create `Vision/IImageLoader.cs` — interface for image acquisition and
  preprocessing
- [ ] Create `Vision/ImageLoader.cs` — load from file path or base64, crop ROI,
  grayscale/threshold preprocessing
- [ ] Write `LobotomyPlaywright.Test/Vision/ImageLoaderTests.cs`

#### Phase 5b: OCR command

- [ ] Add `Tesseract` NuGet package to `LobotomyPlaywright.csproj`
- [ ] Create `Vision/OcrResult.cs` — data models:
  - `OcrTextBlock`: `Text`, `Confidence`, `X`, `Y`, `Width`, `Height`
  - `OcrResult`: `FullText`, `Blocks[]`, `ImageWidth`, `ImageHeight`, `Roi?`,
    `ElapsedMs`
- [ ] Create `Vision/IOcrEngine.cs` — interface for OCR (testability)
- [ ] Create `Vision/TesseractOcrEngine.cs` — Tesseract wrapper implementation
- [ ] Create `Commands/OcrCommand.cs` — CLI command following
  `ScreenshotCommand` pattern (constructor injection with `IConfigManager`,
  `Func<ITcpClient>`, arg parsing via `GetArgValue()`)
  - Args: `--roi x,y,w,h`, `--display text|json`, `--host`, `--port`,
    `--input <path>`, `--threshold 0-100`,
    `--preprocess none|grayscale|threshold`, `--region <name>`
  - Pipeline: acquire image → crop ROI → preprocess → Tesseract → filter by
    confidence → format output
- [ ] Extend `OutputFormatter` with `FormatOcrResult` (text table + JSON modes)
- [ ] Add `"ocr"` case to `Program.cs` switch + update `PrintUsage()`
- [ ] Write `LobotomyPlaywright.Test/Commands/OcrCommandTests.cs`
- [ ] Write `LobotomyPlaywright.Test/Vision/TesseractOcrEngineTests.cs`
  (skip if `eng.traineddata` not found)

#### Phase 5c: Template matching command

- [ ] Create `Vision/MatchResult.cs` — data models:
  - `MatchLocation`: `X`, `Y`, `Width`, `Height`, `Confidence`, `CenterX`,
    `CenterY`
  - `MatchResult`: `Found`, `BestMatch?`, `AllMatches[]`, `TemplatePath`,
    `ImageWidth`, `ImageHeight`, `Roi?`, `ElapsedMs`
- [ ] Create `Vision/ITemplateMatcher.cs` — interface
- [ ] Create `Vision/ImageSharpTemplateMatcher.cs` — NCC algorithm with
  non-maximum suppression
- [ ] Create `Commands/MatchCommand.cs` — CLI command
  - Args: `--template <path>` (required), `--roi x,y,w,h`,
    `--display text|json`, `--host`, `--port`, `--input <path>`,
    `--threshold 0-100`, `--all`, `--region <name>`
  - Pipeline: acquire image → crop ROI → slide template with NCC → filter by
    threshold → non-max suppression → adjust coordinates back to full image →
    format output
- [ ] Extend `OutputFormatter` with `FormatMatchResult`
- [ ] Add `"match"` case to `Program.cs` switch + update `PrintUsage()`
- [ ] Write `LobotomyPlaywright.Test/Commands/MatchCommandTests.cs`
- [ ] Write `LobotomyPlaywright.Test/Vision/ImageSharpTemplateMatcherTests.cs`
  (synthetic test images)

#### Phase 5: Files

**New files:**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `LobotomyPlaywright/Vision/RoiSpec.cs` | ROI data model |
| `LobotomyPlaywright/Vision/IImageLoader.cs` | Image acquisition interface |
| `LobotomyPlaywright/Vision/ImageLoader.cs` | Load/preprocess images |
| `LobotomyPlaywright/Vision/IOcrEngine.cs` | OCR engine interface |
| `LobotomyPlaywright/Vision/TesseractOcrEngine.cs` | Tesseract implementation |
| `LobotomyPlaywright/Vision/OcrResult.cs` | OCR result models |
| `LobotomyPlaywright/Vision/ITemplateMatcher.cs` | Template matcher interface |
| `LobotomyPlaywright/Vision/ImageSharpTemplateMatcher.cs` | NCC template matching |
| `LobotomyPlaywright/Vision/MatchResult.cs` | Match result models |
| `LobotomyPlaywright/Commands/OcrCommand.cs` | OCR CLI command |

| `LobotomyPlaywright/Program.cs` | Add `"ocr"` + `"match"` cases, update `PrintUsage()` |
| `LobotomyPlaywright/Infrastructure/OutputFormatter.cs` | Add `FormatOcrResult` + `FormatMatchResult` |

#### Phase 5: Tests (≥80% coverage gate)

- [ ] `ImageLoaderTests.cs` — load from file, load from base64, ROI crop,
  grayscale/threshold preprocessing, invalid inputs
- [ ] `OcrCommandTests.cs` — config loading, invalid args, connection errors,
  successful OCR (mocked engine), ROI parsing, display formats
- [ ] `TesseractOcrEngineTests.cs` — text extraction with test images,
  confidence thresholding, ROI (skip if Tesseract not installed)
- [ ] `MatchCommandTests.cs` — missing template arg, connection errors,
  successful match (mocked matcher), display formats
- [ ] `ImageSharpTemplateMatcherTests.cs` — synthetic images: perfect match,
  no match, multiple matches, ROI constraint
- [ ] `OutputFormatterTests.cs` — extend with `FormatOcrResult` and
  `FormatMatchResult` text/JSON modes

#### Phase 5 completion checklist

- [ ] Dotnet tool coverage ≥80% overall (Coverlet report)
- [ ] `dotnet playwright ocr --input <screenshot.png>` returns recognized text
- [ ] `dotnet playwright match --template <button.png> --input <screenshot.png>`
  returns match location
- [ ] End-to-end: launch game → `dotnet playwright ocr` captures live screenshot
  and returns text

### Phase 6 — Named vision regions

**Status:** Not started

A `regions.json` config file maps named regions to ROI coordinates and/or
template image paths. This lets the agent use `--region energy_bar` instead of
`--roi 800,20,300,40`.

- [ ] Create `Interfaces/Configuration/IRegionsConfig.cs`
- [ ] Create `Implementations/Configuration/RegionsConfig.cs` — loads
  `regions.json` following existing `IConfigManager` pattern
- [ ] `regions.json` schema:
  ```json
  {
    "regions": {
      "energy_bar": {
        "roi": { "x": 800, "y": 20, "width": 300, "height": 40 }
      },
      "work_button": {
        "template": "templates/work_button.png"
      },
      "agent_panel": {
        "roi": { "x": 0, "y": 100, "width": 400, "height": 800 },
        "template": "templates/agent_panel_header.png"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- [ ] Wire `--region <name>` into `OcrCommand` and `MatchCommand`
- [ ] Write region config tests
- [ ] Create sample `regions.json` template

#### Phase 6: Tests (≥80% coverage gate)

- [ ] `RegionsConfigTests.cs` — load valid config, missing file, invalid JSON,
  region lookup by name, region with ROI only, template only, both
- [ ] `OcrCommandTests.cs` — extend with `--region` resolution tests
- [ ] `MatchCommandTests.cs` — extend with `--region` resolution tests

#### Phase 6 completion checklist

- [ ] Dotnet tool coverage ≥80% overall (Coverlet report)
- [ ] `--region <name>` resolves to correct ROI/template in both commands
- [ ] Sample `regions.json` ships with the tool

## Key Game References

These decompiled files in `external/decompiled/Assembly-CSharp/` are the most
critical for understanding available game state. The agent should reference
these when building queries or commands.

### Core managers (singletons)

| File | Access | What it holds |
|------|--------|---------------|
| `GameManager.cs` | `GameManager.currentGameManager` | Game state, speed, pause, energy, day management |
| `AgentManager.cs` | `AgentManager.instance` | All agents (hired, spare), agent creation/deletion |
| `CreatureManager.cs` | `CreatureManager.instance` | All abnormalities, observation info, creature lifecycle |
| `SefiraManager.cs` | `SefiraManager.instance` | Departments, room assignments, department unlocking |
| `PlayerModel.cs` | `PlayerModel.instance` | Player resources (LOB points), day counter, research |
| `OrdealManager.cs` | `OrdealManager.instance` | Ordeal state, activation, types |

### Core models

| File | What it represents |
|------|--------------------|
| `WorkerModel.cs` | Base for agents — HP, mental, stats, position, state, panic, death |
| `AgentModel.cs` | Agent-specific: name, gifts, E.G.O. equipment, promotion, customization |
| `CreatureModel.cs` | Abnormality: metadata, qliphoth counter, feeling state, work count, skills |
| `UnitModel.cs` | Base for all units — buffs, defense, damage |
| `Sefira.cs` | Department: agents, rooms, abnormalities assigned |

### Event system

| File | What it provides |
|------|-----------------|
| `Notice.cs` | Pub/sub event bus — `Observe()`, `Send()`, `Remove()` |
| `NoticeName.cs` | ~80+ named events as static string fields |
| `IObserver.cs` | Observer interface for event callbacks |

### Console / Debug

| File | What it provides |
|------|-----------------|
| `ConsoleCommand.cs` | Debug command string constants (useful for Phase 3) |
| `ConsoleScript.cs` | Command execution logic |

### Other useful references

| File | Why it matters |
|------|---------------|
| `CreatureEquipmentMakeInfo.cs` | E.G.O. gift/equipment generation and probability |
| `UseSkill.cs` | Work session mechanics |
| `CreatureObserveInfoModel.cs` | Observation levels per abnormality |
| `AgentHistory.cs` | Agent work history |
| `EGOgiftModel.cs` | E.G.O. gift data |

## Open Questions

- **JSON library for .NET 3.5**: The plugin needs JSON serialization without
  `System.Text.Json` or `Newtonsoft.Json` (which targets newer .NET). Options
  include Unity's built-in `JsonUtility` (limited — no dictionaries, no
  polymorphism), `MiniJSON` (single-file, commonly used in Unity modding), or a
  hand-rolled minimal serializer. Needs evaluation during Phase 1.
- **Private field access**: Many manager fields (e.g., `AgentManager.agentList`)
  are private. Harmony's `Traverse` API or direct reflection can access them,
  but we should standardize on one approach for consistency.
- **Port conflicts**: Default port `8484` should be configurable. Need to
  document what to do if another app uses it.
- **Game version coupling**: The plugin is tightly coupled to the game's class
  structure. If the game updates (unlikely for Lobotomy Corporation, which is
  no longer actively developed), queries may break. Document which game version
  is targeted.

## Risks & Considerations

### Technical risks

- **Unity thread safety**: All game state access must happen on the main thread.
  The TCP server runs on a background thread, so requests must be queued and
  processed during `Update()`. Failing to do this will cause crashes or
  corrupted state. This is the single most important architectural constraint.
- **.NET 3.5 limitations**: No `async/await`, no `Task`, no modern collections.
  TCP handling must use `BeginAcceptTcpClient`/`EndAcceptTcpClient` or manual
  threading. JSON handling is limited (see Open Questions).
- **Reflection fragility**: Accessing private fields via reflection is fragile if
  field names change. Using Harmony `Traverse` is slightly more robust and
  consistent with the existing codebase.

### Operational risks

- **Performance impact**: Serializing large game state on every query could
  affect frame rate. Consider caching, pagination, or delta-based responses for
  large datasets (e.g., 50 agents × full detail).
- **Connection lifecycle**: The game may reload scenes (day transitions, restarts)
  which could affect singleton availability. The plugin must handle null
  managers gracefully and report "game not in queryable state" rather than
  crashing.
- **Security**: The TCP server listens on localhost only. This is intentional —
  it's a development/debugging tool, not a production service. Document this
  clearly.
- **External volume availability**: The game lives on an external SSD
  (`/Volumes/WD_BLACK SN770 1TB/`). If the volume is not mounted, deploy and
  launch scripts must fail with a clear message rather than silently
  misbehaving. Scripts should check volume/path existence before any operation.
- **CrossOver dependency**: Game launch automation relies on CrossOver's
  `cxstart` CLI (`/Applications/CrossOver.app/...`). If CrossOver is not
  installed or is at a different path, launch will fail. The path should be
  discoverable or configurable.
- **Game startup time variability**: The game's startup time (from `cxstart`
  invocation to TCP server ready) depends on the machine and Wine translation
  overhead. The default 60-second timeout should be generous, with progress
  feedback so the agent doesn't assume failure prematurely.
- **Process detection reliability**: Identifying the game's Wine process on
  macOS requires parsing process lists for CrossOver/Wine processes running
  `LobotomyCorp.exe`. This is heuristic-based and could match incorrectly if
  multiple Wine bottles are active. Process detection should be as specific as
  possible (match on executable name and bottle).

### Vision / OCR risks

- **Tesseract native dependency**: Requires `brew install tesseract` on macOS.
  Must document this prerequisite. Tests that need Tesseract should skip
  gracefully when not installed.
- **Template matching performance**: NCC is O(W×H×tw×th). For 1920×1080
  screenshots with ~100px templates, this should complete in <1 second. If too
  slow, can add pyramid/multi-scale optimization later.
- **Game resolution variability**: ROI coordinates depend on screen resolution.
  Named regions may need resolution-aware scaling in the future, but for now
  assume fixed resolution.
- **Tesseract accuracy on stylized text**: If the game uses heavily stylized
  fonts, Tesseract may struggle. Preprocessing (grayscale + threshold) helps.
  Could fine-tune a custom traineddata file if needed.

### Design considerations

- **Lobotomy Corporation-specific vocabulary**: Use game domain terms in the API
  (agents, abnormalities, departments, E.G.O., qliphoth) rather than generic
  Unity terms. This makes the pi agent's output immediately meaningful.
- **Idempotent queries**: State queries should be safe to call at any frequency
  without side effects.
- **Graceful degradation**: If a manager isn't available (e.g., game is on the
  title screen), return a clear status rather than an error. The agent should
  be able to ask "is the game in a queryable state?" before diving into
  specifics.
